#VinjEx

A *simple* lib for DLL Injection, using [Easyhook](https://easyhook.github.io/).

*Too simple, sometimes naive.  -Elder*

###VinjEx is inspired by `VInj` & `VInjDn`.

(Sorry but I can not find the author. Anyway, thank him/her! )

I used to use VInjDn in my projects, but VInjDn is old and sometimes unstable.

When using Easyhook, I find it is inconvenient for two-way communication.

So I made `VinjEx`. It has similar syntax as VInjDn, easy to use, and more stable.

###LICENSE

LGPL (because Easyhook uses)
