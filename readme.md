# VinjExA *simple* lib for DLL Injection, using [Easyhook](https://easyhook.github.io/).*Too simple, sometimes naive.  -Elder*### VinjEx is inspired by `VInj` & `VInjDn`.(Sorry but I can not find the author. Anyway, thank him/her! )I used to use VInjDn in my projects, but VInjDn is old and sometimes unstable.When using Easyhook, I find it is inconvenient for two-way communication.So I made `VinjEx`. It has similar syntax as VInjDn, easy to use, and more stable.#### Glad to be recommended by git@osc.
